# Background:

We need to update `TAKI Game Development Plan - Unity Engine` - We have completely finished `HAND IN 1 - SINGLEPLAYER (Human vs AI)`, now we need to focus on `HAND IN 2 - MULTIPLAYER (Human vs human)`.
`TAKI Game - Complete Script Documentation & Reference Guide` is a documentation of OUR scripts for SINGLEPLAYER. Our gaol is to expnd our PART 1 project to  PART  2. We need to basically COPY ONE TO ONE our instructors example project, with the whole room conectionstuff happening.
OUR project is of the game TAKI, a bit simular to the game UNO.
Our INSTRUCTOR's game is Tic-tac-toe, much much simpler, and contains the scripts I've attached: **SpritesManager, Slot, MenuLogic, GameOver, GameLogic, GameBoard, BoardStateCheck.**

# Tasks:

- We need to create a documentation for our instructor's scripts
- We need to update `TAKI Game Development Plan - Unity Engine` - Summarize what we have/ what we achieved and implemented in PART 1, make sure to keep the heirarcies.
- We need to update `TAKI Game Development Plan - Unity Engine` -  and then create and carefuly plan our broad phases, milestones and steps for implementing our PART 2 of our project in our instructor's Tic-tac-toe game's image.

# More notes:

- I want us to be mindful of the correlations between OUR scripts, and our INSTRUCTOR's scripts
- Our structure may be a bit different, yet we HAVE to follow the multiplayer game directions as strictly as we can, while being mindful of our own work as well.
- I want you to consolidate with me on important things like structures for example. 
- I can see that our instructor has `MenuLogic.cs` for example, and we have `MenuNavigation.cs` - Should we add onto our `MenuNavigation.cs` everything `MenuLogic.cs` has, or will it be wiser to create another script?
- We must also always remember our unity engine components and connections.

Understood?

Alright, llet's disscus.


## 🔍 **Key Correlations I've Identified**

### **Script Mapping Analysis**:
```
INSTRUCTOR (Tic-tac-toe) ↔ OUR PROJECT (TAKI)
MenuLogic.cs ↔ MenuNavigation.cs + NEW multiplayer logic
GameLogic.cs ↔ GameManager.cs + multiplayer coordination  
GameBoard.cs ↔ GameStateManager.cs + network state sync
BoardStateCheck.cs ↔ Rule validation (distributed across our scripts)
GameOver.cs ↔ GameEndManager.cs + network game end
Slot.cs ↔ CardController.cs + network card actions
SpritesManager.cs ↔ Our resource management (distributed)
```

# 🤔 **Critical Design Decisions to Discuss**

## **Architecture Questions**:
1. **MenuLogic vs MenuNavigation**: Should we enhance `MenuNavigation.cs` or create separate `MultiplayerMenuLogic.cs`? I believe creating a separate `MultiplayerMenuLogic.cs` will be a wiser decision.
2. **Network State Management**: How do we sync our complex TAKI game state vs simple Tic-tac-toe board? + 3. **Card Synchronization**: How do we handle card hands, deck state, and special card effects across network?
I think in Tic-tac-toe we had to always keep making sure that the board is Synchronized, and in Taki, we will need to keep making sure that the card hands and card piles (discard and draw) are Synchronized
4. **Turn Management**: Adapt our strict turn flow system to network multiplayer

# 🎯 **Proposed Approach**

1. **First**: Create comprehensive instructor script documentation
2. **Then**: Consolidate PART 1 achievements with clear hierarchy preservation  
3. **Finally**: Design PART 2 phases that mirror instructor's multiplayer pattern while respecting our TAKI complexity

Yup, sounds good!

## ❓ **Key Consultation Points**

- **Script Organization**: Enhance existing vs create new multiplayer-specific scripts? I think that is a different decision to make for every situation separately, it depends. Maybe it's better for this to be discussed when approaching every milestone, and not define all the scripts' structures now.
- **State Synchronization**: How to handle our complex multi-enum architecture over network? Let's see what my instructor did for achieving State Synchronization.
- **Component Integration**: How to preserve our Unity component connections in multiplayer? Let's see what my instructor did for achieving Component Integration.
- **Special Cards**: How to sync TAKI's complex special card effects (PlusTwo chains, sequences) across network? This can definitely wait for future discussions when we actually get to implementing this, don't you think?

# My notes:

You can start on steps 1 and 2: 
1. **First**: Create comprehensive instructor script documentation
2. **Then**: Consolidate PART 1 achievements with clear hierarchy preservation  
3. **Finally**: Design PART 2 phases that mirror instructor's multiplayer pattern while respecting our TAKI complexity

Before step 3, I want to make sure we are on the same page first.

Looking at:

```csharp
using Photon.Pun;
using Photon.Realtime;
using System;
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using TMPro;
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.UI;

namespace TakiGame
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Handles Photon PUN2 multiplayer connection, matchmaking, and room management for TAKI
    /// Adapted from instructor's MenuLogic.cs pattern
    /// Integrates with existing MenuNavigation.cs system
    /// </summary>
    public class MultiplayerMenuLogic : MonoBehaviourPunCallbacks
    {
        [Header("Events")]
        public static Action OnMultiplayerGameReady;

        [Header("Room Configuration")]
        [SerializeField] private int searchValue = 100; // Different from instructor's 100 for TAKI
        [SerializeField] private int maxPlayers = 2;    // TAKI is 2-player game
        [SerializeField] private string password = "taki2025"; // TAKI-specific password

        [Header("UI References - Auto-Found")]
        [SerializeField] private Button playButton;
        [SerializeField] private TextMeshProUGUI statusText;
        [SerializeField] private GameObject multiplayerGameScreen;
        [SerializeField] private GameObject multiplayerMenuScreen;

        [Header("Integration")]
        [SerializeField] private MenuNavigation menuNavigation;

        // Connection state tracking
        private bool isConnecting = false;
        private bool isInRoom = false;
```

Notes:

- Maybe `OnMultiplayerGameReady`in `public static Action OnStartMultiplayerGame` should be called `OnMultiplayerGameReady'.

- Do we not need `private Dictionary<string, GameObject> unityObjects`?

- What does it mean by `[SerializeField]`?

- `searchValue = 100;` is like the amount of money a player wants to bid, we can keep it `100`.

- `password = "taki2025"` is more correct

- I noticed you added these, how come you added thes, but we don't see them in `MenuLogic`?

    - Where did `[SerializeField] private Button playButton` come from? Did you mean `Btn_MultiPlayer`?

    - Where did `[SerializeField] private TextMeshProUGUI statusText` come from? Did you mean `Txt_Status`?

    - And these?
    ```
        [SerializeField] private GameObject multiplayerGameScreen;
        [SerializeField] private GameObject multiplayerMenuScreen;

        [Header("Integration")]
        [SerializeField] private MenuNavigation menuNavigation;

        // Connection state tracking
        private bool isConnecting = false;
        private bool isInRoom = false;

    ```

# Current Status Summary
What's Working Perfectly:

Connection to Photon ✓
Room creation ✓
Status updates in UI ✓
Button state management ✓
Following instructor's pattern ✓

Next Steps - Following Our Plan:MenuNavigation.cs - Clean Multiplayer LoggingCode
 		/// <summary>
		/// ENHANCED: Multiplayer button now starts Photon connection process
		/// Following instructor's pattern: immediate connection attempt on menu selection
		/// CLEANED: Reduced logging noise
		/// </summary>

# public void Btn_Multi🎯 What We've Achieved
Phase 1: Network Foundation - MILESTONE 1 COMPLETE:

✅ Photon Integration: Connection, rooms, matchmaking working perfectly
✅ Room Management: Following instructor's pattern exactly
✅ UI Integration: Status updates and button control working
✅ Clean Architecture: Direct references, minimal logging

# 🎯 Next Steps - Immediate Actions: Test Two-Player Connection
Before building more, we should test if two instances can connect:

Build the current project
Run two instances (one in editor, one as build)
Verify they connect to the same room
Confirm OnMultiplayerGameReady event fires when both join
