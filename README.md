### **Primary Goal**: Clean up excessive logging and implement proper log level system
**Status**: 🎯 **IMMEDIATE FOCUS** - Ready for implementation

### **Objectives**:
1. **Implement Log Level System**: Create configurable logging with different verbosity levels
2. **Clean Console Output**: Reduce debug spam while preserving essential information
3. **Organize Debug Messages**: Categorize logs by system (Turn Flow, Card Play, AI, UI, etc.)
4. **Preserve Critical Logs**: Keep important game state and error messages
5. **Add Production Mode**: Toggle for minimal logging in release builds

### **Implementation Tasks**:

#### **A. Create Log Management System**:
```csharp
// New utility class for centralized logging
public enum LogLevel { None, Error, Warning, Info, Debug, Verbose }
public static class TakiLogger {
    public static LogLevel currentLogLevel = LogLevel.Info;
    public static void LogTurnFlow(string message) { /* conditional logging */ }
    public static void LogCardPlay(string message) { /* conditional logging */ }
    public static void LogAI(string message) { /* conditional logging */ }
    public static void LogUI(string message) { /* conditional logging */ }
}
```

#### **B. Categorize Existing Logs**:
- **Turn Flow**: All strict turn flow messages
- **Card Play**: Card validation and play messages  
- **AI System**: Computer decision making
- **UI Updates**: Button states and display changes
- **Game State**: Critical state transitions
- **Errors**: Always show regardless of log level

#### **C. Update All Scripts**:
- Replace `Debug.Log()` calls with categorized logging
- Add log level configuration to GameManager
- Create inspector toggle for production mode
- Preserve error and warning messages always

#### **D. Performance Optimization**:
- Remove string concatenation in disabled log calls
- Use conditional compilation for release builds
- Cache frequently logged strings
- Optimize debug message formatting

2. **Stop Card**: Skip computer's next turn
3. **ChangeDirection Card**: Reverse turn order (for multiplayer readiness)
4. **PlusTwo Card**: Computer draws 2, chaining mechanism
5. **ChangeColor Card**: Full color selection implementation
6. **Taki Card**: Multi-card play sequence of same color

public enum GameStatus { Active, Paused, GameOver }
```

### **Visual Card Architecture**:
```csharp
// Complete visual card system
CardController: Individual card behavior, image loading, selection
HandManager: Dynamic hand layout, card positioning, user interaction
PileManager: Draw/discard pile visual representation
```

### **Clean UI Messaging System**:
```csharp
// Proper message routing with updated hierarchy
GameplayUIManager.ShowPlayerMessage(): Instructions and warnings to player
GameplayUIManager.ShowComputerMessage(): AI actions and thinking messages
DeckUIManager: Deck-specific events and counts only
```

## Development Guidelines

### Architecture Principles
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each component has single responsibility
- **Event-Driven Communication**: Components communicate via events
- **Coordinator Pattern**: Managers delegate to specialized components  
- **Multi-Enum State**: Separate enums for different state aspects
- **Visual-Data Separation**: CardData separate from visual representation
- **Strict Turn Flow**: One action per turn with enforced completion
- **Clean Logging**: Categorized, level-controlled debugging information

### Current Development Workflow
1. **Start with Code Cleanup**: Implement log level system before new features
2. **Test in Controlled Environment**: Use strict turn flow for safe testing
3. **Minimal Console Spam**: Keep debugging focused and relevant
4. **Document Changes**: Update development plan when making modifications
5. **Preserve Architecture**: Maintain clean separation of concerns

AMAZING! Work MUCH better now!

When it's my turn currently, I can basically do whatever I want as long as the cards are legal -PLAY and DRAW however many cards as I want.

I  want to play it safely, so here are my rules - user story:

1. Player turn starts
2. END TURN button is disabled
3. If player has no valid cards to play at all:
  1. Log a clear message - Player has no valid cards, must draw a card
  2. Player clicks on DRAW
  3. Log a clear message - Player has no more valid moves, must end turn
  4. Player clicks on END TURN
  5. Turn ends
4. If player has valid cards:
  1. Log a clear message - Player has valid cards, Play or DRAW a card draw a card
  2. If Player clicks on DRAW
    1. Log a clear message - Player has no more valid moves, must end turn

    2. Log a clear message - Player has no more valid moves, must end turn
    3. Player clicks on END TURN
    4. Turn ends

I want us to start basic, and safe - so as of now, ALL cards must act like BASIC cards and COMPLETELY obey the legal flow.











Update `TAKI Game Development Plan`, it needs some modifying.
Our next steps (update/include/change them):

A. Create a doucument that will contain all information needed on ALL of our scripts. This is so we don't need to attach each time all of our scripts- Instead we will build a prompt, attach the scripts summaries and ask Claude to notify which files are needed for this prompt. 
To do this we will thoroghly analyse each and every one of our files.

B. Clean all the scripts up a bit - There are so many logs that it's very difficult to understand what is happening- at this point we can safely move to more simple and minimal logs.

C. Implement Pause button.

D. Implement Game end properly - a screen will pop up with a fitting message + 2 buttons - play again or return to main menu screen.

E. Lightly reconstruct some things in the hierarchy: 
- `GameMessageText` is not named properly as its actual functionality, instead it should be named `DeckMessageText`. This must be done very carefully, we need to see what needs to be done in both the unity engine and the scripts.
- `Player2MessagePanel` and `Player2MessageText` are not named properly as their actual functionality, instead they should be named `GameMessagePanel` and `GameMessageText`. This must be done very carefully, we need to see what needs to be done in both the unity engine and the scripts.

F. Finally, when we know the basic rule gameplay truly works, we can move on to implementing the special cards

G. Final polish :)




Before Milestone 8, we are jumping to Milestone 11: UI Hierarchy Restructuring first
