---

## Phase 2: Core Card System

### Milestone 3: Data Architecture Implementation ✅ COMPLETE
**Achievements**:
- ✅ Complete enum system with **Multi-Enum Architecture**:
  - `TurnState`: WHO is acting? (PlayerTurn, ComputerTurn, Neutral)
  - `InteractionState`: WHAT special interaction? (Normal, ColorSelection, TakiSequence, PlusTwoChain) 
  - `GameStatus`: WHAT is overall status? (Active, Paused, GameOver)
- ✅ CardData ScriptableObject with helper methods and rule validation
- ✅ Namespace organization (`TakiGame`)
- ✅ 110-card complete deck system with automatic generation
- ✅ UI integration tested and working

### Milestone 4: Complete Deck System ✅ COMPLETE
**Achievements**:
- ✅ **Refactored Architecture** using **Single Responsibility Principle**:
  - `Deck`: Pure card operations (draw, discard, shuffle)
  - `CardDataLoader`: Resource management (load 110 cards from Resources)
  - `DeckUIManager`: UI updates only (deck counts, messages) 
  - `GameSetupManager`: Game initialization logic (deal hands, place starting card)
  - `DeckManager`: Coordinator pattern (delegates to specialized components)
- ✅ All 110 cards load and distribute correctly (8+8+1 setup working)
- ✅ Automatic deck initialization and UI updates
- ✅ **Wild as initial color** (represents "no color set yet")
- ✅ Event-driven architecture connecting all components
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns for future multiplayer readiness

---

### Milestone 5: Turn Management System 🎯 **CURRENTLY IN PROGRESS**
**Objective**: Implement turn-based mechanics with basic computer AI

**Architecture Completed**:
- ✅ **Multi-Enum Game State Architecture**:
  - `GameStateManager`: Manages TurnState, InteractionState, GameStatus, active color, rules
  - `TurnManager`: Handles turn switching, timing, player transitions
  - `BasicComputerAI`: Simple AI with random number selection strategy  
  - `GameplayUIManager`: Turn-related UI updates (turn indicator, game state, hand sizes)
  - `GameManager`: Main coordinator for all gameplay systems

**Current Status**: Scripts created and updated, need to configure Unity GameObject setup and test integration

**Remaining Tasks**:
- Configure GameManager GameObject with all components
- Create and connect UI elements for turn display
- Test turn switching and AI decision making
- Verify multi-enum architecture working correctly
- Test basic gameplay loop (draw card, play card, turn switching)

**Key Improvements Made**:
- ✅ **AI random number selection** (numbers don't matter strategically in TAKI)
- ✅ **Cleaner AddCardsToHand** implementation using loop
- ✅ **Wild color UI maintenance** (UI keeps previous color for wild cards)
- ✅ **No animation complexity** (faster development focus)

## Current Architecture Highlights

### **Multi-Enum State Management**:
```csharp
// Clean separation of state concerns
public enum TurnState { PlayerTurn, ComputerTurn, Neutral }
public enum InteractionState { Normal, ColorSelection, TakiSequence, PlusTwoChain }
public enum GameStatus { Active, Paused, GameOver }
```

### **Component Separation Benefits**:
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one clear job
- **Easier Testing**: Test systems in isolation
- **Better Maintainability**: Changes to one system don't affect others
- **Multiplayer Ready**: Network synchronization easier with separated logic
- **Event-Driven**: Clean communication between systems

### **Coordinator Pattern**:
- `DeckManager`: Coordinates deck operations
- `GameManager`: Coordinates gameplay systems  
- Both delegate to specialized components while providing unified APIs

---

## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards
```csharp
namespace TakiGame {
    // Multi-enum state management
    public class GameStateManager : MonoBehaviour {
        [Tooltip("Whose turn is it currently?")]
        public TurnState turnState = TurnState.Neutral;
        
        [Tooltip("What special interaction is happening?")]
        public InteractionState interactionState = InteractionState.Normal;
        
        // NO UNICODE in comments or strings
        // Use simple ASCII characters only
    }
}
```

### Architecture Principles
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each component has single responsibility
- **Event-Driven Communication**: Components communicate via events
- **Coordinator Pattern**: Managers delegate to specialized components  
- **Multi-Enum State**: Separate enums for different state aspects
- **Wild Initial Values**: Use Wild/Neutral for "not set yet" states

### Testing Strategy
1. **Component Testing**: Each component tested independently (Milestone 5)
2. **Integration Testing**: Test component interactions (Milestone 5)  
3. **Visual Gameplay Testing**: Full testing with card prefabs (Milestone 6)
4. **Rule Validation Testing**: All card rules working (Milestone 7+)

---

---

## Risk Mitigation & Current Challenges

### Milestone 5 Focus Areas:
1. **Component Integration**: Ensure all 5 new components work together correctly
2. **Multi-Enum Coordination**: Verify state transitions are clean and logical  
3. **AI Decision Quality**: Basic AI should make reasonable moves
4. **UI Responsiveness**: Turn changes should update UI immediately
5. **Event System Reliability**: No missing or double-fired events

### Next Phase Preparation:
- **Milestone 6 will be major testing phase** with visual card prefabs
- Current focus: Get core gameplay loop working with number-based hands
- Heavy testing postponed until visual cards are implemented

I'm taking the following notes/making the code changes right after "Step 1: Create All Script Files" and before "Step 2: Set Up GameManager GameObject".

- In `GameStateManager.cs`:

    - I changed `public CardColor activeColor = CardColor.Red;` to:
        ```
    	[Tooltip ("Active color that must be matched (White = no color set yet)")]
		public CardColor activeColor = CardColor.Wild; // Wild = neutral/white initially
        ```
        Reasoning: Wild represents "no specific color" which is perfect for initial state.


    - I removed `public bool strictRules = true;` - This is redundant.

- In `BasicComputerAI`:

    - Looking into `SelectBestCard`, "higher numbers" doesn't make sense. For TAKI, number value doesn't matter for strategy, so I fixed `SelectFromNumberCards`:
        ```
    	/// <summary>
		/// Select random number card
		/// </summary>
		/// <param name="numberCards">Available number cards</param>
		/// <returns>Selected number card</returns>
		CardData SelectFromNumberCards (List<CardData> numberCards) {
			return numberCards [Random.Range (0, numberCards.Count)];
		}
        ```

    - `AddCardsToHand` should just call `AddCardToHand` in a loop, I fixed the code:
        ```
    	public void AddCardsToHand (List<CardData> cards) {
			foreach (CardData card in cards) {
				AddCardToHand (card);
			}
			Debug.Log ($"AI received {cards.Count} cards. Hand size: {computerHand.Count}");
		}
        ```

- In `GameplayUIManager.cs`:

    - I can see that `public Color wildColor = Color.white;`, and I am debating myself if this direction is good - I think it is, but we need to tread carefully, as I metioned in my note on `GameStateManager`

    - `GetColorForCardColor`, Wild cards shouldn't change color indicator, wild cards should maintain previous color, I fixed the code:
        ```
		/// <summary>
		/// Convert CardColor to Unity Color
		/// </summary>
		/// <param name="cardColor">Card color to convert</param>
		/// <returns>Unity color</returns>
		Color GetColorForCardColor (CardColor cardColor) {
			switch (cardColor) {
				case CardColor.Red:
					return redColor;
				case CardColor.Blue:
					return blueColor;
				case CardColor.Green:
					return greenColor;
				case CardColor.Yellow:
					return yellowColor;
				default:
					return wildColor;
			}
		}
        ```

    - I removed `PulseElement` and `HighlightActiveColor` methods entirely. No animations = faster development, fewer bugs.

---

- I've gotten to the conclusion that we have a in regards to the GameState enum: I think we should either seperate it into different enum groups like: 
        - PlayerTurn, ComputerTurn, + another third neutral option
        - ColorSelection, TakiSequence, PlusTwoChain,, + another neutral option
        - GameOver, Paused, + another third neutral option
    - Or do you maybe have another better idea?
    - Anyhow, this will require changing many many different files, so we need to go and look over EACH ONE of our files and check.
New Multi-Enum Architecture Proposal:
```
// Who's turn is it?
public enum TurnState {
    PlayerTurn,
    ComputerTurn,
    Neutral    // During transitions, game over, etc.
}

// What special interaction is happening?  
public enum InteractionState {
    Normal,           // Regular gameplay
    ColorSelection,   // ChangeColor card played
    TakiSequence,     // TAKI multi-play active
    PlusTwoChain      // +2 cards being chained
}

// What's the overall game status?
public enum GameStatus {
    Active,    // Game is running normally
    Paused,    // Game paused
    GameOver   // Game ended
}
```
Now we need to update all relevant files accordingly


---

I have updated all the scripts, I haven't yet gotten to Step 3: Configure GameManager GameObject. Before that I want to start a ne prompt since this one is getting long and heavy - in order to do that I need to update my project's "Set project instructions" and attached "Files".

1.I need your suggestion on what files I should attach and which are not necessary, I know that it's best to give claude the needed and relevant information, so aside from the "Set project instructions", which files should be attached?

2.I want you to give me back in canvas "Set project instructions", but with the following changes:

A. Make sure all our architectural changes, and any important changes are updated in the doucument.

B. We completed "Milestone 4" and are currently in the middle of "Milestone 5" - Update what's completed and what's left to do. Remember that the heavier testing is planned for after creating the card prefabs (in "Milestone 6" if I remember correctly).

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup ✅ COMPLETE

### Milestone 1: Menu System ✅ COMPLETE
**Status**: All scenes and navigation working

### Milestone 2: UI Framework Creation ✅ COMPLETE  
**Status**: Full UI hierarchy established, all panels created

---

## Phase 2: Core Card System

### Milestone 3: Data Architecture Implementation ✅ COMPLETE
**Achievements**:
- ✅ Complete enum system with **Multi-Enum Architecture**:
  - `TurnState`: WHO is acting? (PlayerTurn, ComputerTurn, Neutral)
  - `InteractionState`: WHAT special interaction? (Normal, ColorSelection, TakiSequence, PlusTwoChain) 
  - `GameStatus`: WHAT is overall status? (Active, Paused, GameOver)
- ✅ CardData ScriptableObject with helper methods and rule validation
- ✅ Namespace organization (`TakiGame`)
- ✅ 110-card complete deck system with automatic generation
- ✅ UI integration tested and working

### Milestone 4: Complete Deck System ✅ COMPLETE
**Achievements**:
- ✅ **Refactored Architecture** using **Single Responsibility Principle**:
  - `Deck`: Pure card operations (draw, discard, shuffle)
  - `CardDataLoader`: Resource management (load 110 cards from Resources)
  - `DeckUIManager`: UI updates only (deck counts, messages) 
  - `GameSetupManager`: Game initialization logic (deal hands, place starting card)
  - `DeckManager`: Coordinator pattern (delegates to specialized components)
- ✅ All 110 cards load and distribute correctly (8+8+1 setup working)
- ✅ Automatic deck initialization and UI updates
- ✅ **Wild as initial color** (represents "no color set yet")
- ✅ Event-driven architecture connecting all components
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns for future multiplayer readiness

### Milestone 5: Turn Management System 🎯 **CURRENTLY IN PROGRESS**
**Objective**: Implement turn-based mechanics with basic computer AI

**Architecture Completed**:
- ✅ **Multi-Enum Game State Architecture**:
  - `GameStateManager`: Manages TurnState, InteractionState, GameStatus, active color, rules
  - `TurnManager`: Handles turn switching, timing, player transitions
  - `BasicComputerAI`: Simple AI with random number selection strategy  
  - `GameplayUIManager`: Turn-related UI updates (turn indicator, game state, hand sizes)
  - `GameManager`: Main coordinator for all gameplay systems

**Current Status**: Scripts created and updated, need to configure Unity GameObject setup and test integration

**Remaining Tasks**:
- Configure GameManager GameObject with all components
- Create and connect UI elements for turn display
- Test turn switching and AI decision making
- Verify multi-enum architecture working correctly
- Test basic gameplay loop (draw card, play card, turn switching)

**Key Improvements Made**:
- ✅ **AI random number selection** (numbers don't matter strategically in TAKI)
- ✅ **Cleaner AddCardsToHand** implementation using loop
- ✅ **Wild color UI maintenance** (UI keeps previous color for wild cards)
- ✅ **No animation complexity** (faster development focus)

## Phase 3: Basic Gameplay Loop

### Milestone 6: Hand Management System  
**Objective**: Visual card representation and hand interaction

**Planned Features**:
- Card prefab creation with visual representation
- Hand display system with proper spacing
- Card selection and interaction
- Visual feedback for valid/invalid moves
- **Major testing phase** - Full gameplay testing with visual cards

### Milestone 7: Basic Card Rules System
**Objective**: Complete rule validation and card effects

### Milestone 8: Color Selection System
**Objective**: ChangeColor card functionality with UI

---

## Phase 4: Special Cards Implementation

### Milestone 9: Action Cards (Plus, Stop, PlusTwo)
### Milestone 10: Advanced Cards (TAKI & SuperTaki)

---

## Phase 5: Final Polish & Features

### Milestone 11: Win/Lose System
### Milestone 12: Menu Integration  
### Milestone 13: Final Polish

---

## Current Architecture Highlights

### **Multi-Enum State Management**:
```csharp
// Clean separation of state concerns
public enum TurnState { PlayerTurn, ComputerTurn, Neutral }
public enum InteractionState { Normal, ColorSelection, TakiSequence, PlusTwoChain }
public enum GameStatus { Active, Paused, GameOver }
```

### **Component Separation Benefits**:
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one clear job
- **Easier Testing**: Test systems in isolation
- **Better Maintainability**: Changes to one system don't affect others
- **Multiplayer Ready**: Network synchronization easier with separated logic
- **Event-Driven**: Clean communication between systems

### **Coordinator Pattern**:
- `DeckManager`: Coordinates deck operations
- `GameManager`: Coordinates gameplay systems  
- Both delegate to specialized components while providing unified APIs

## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards
```csharp
namespace TakiGame {
    // Multi-enum state management
    public class GameStateManager : MonoBehaviour {
        [Tooltip("Whose turn is it currently?")]
        public TurnState turnState = TurnState.Neutral;
        
        [Tooltip("What special interaction is happening?")]
        public InteractionState interactionState = InteractionState.Normal;
        
        // NO UNICODE in comments or strings
        // Use simple ASCII characters only
    }
}
```

### Architecture Principles
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each component has single responsibility
- **Event-Driven Communication**: Components communicate via events
- **Coordinator Pattern**: Managers delegate to specialized components  
- **Multi-Enum State**: Separate enums for different state aspects
- **Wild Initial Values**: Use Wild/Neutral for "not set yet" states

### Testing Strategy
1. **Component Testing**: Each component tested independently (Milestone 5)
2. **Integration Testing**: Test component interactions (Milestone 5)  
3. **Visual Gameplay Testing**: Full testing with card prefabs (Milestone 6)
4. **Rule Validation Testing**: All card rules working (Milestone 7+)
