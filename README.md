### Milestone 4: Complete Deck System üéØ CURRENT TARGET
**Objective**: Refactor DeckManager architecture and implement complete deck system

## Current DeckManager Problems (Too Many Responsibilities!)
1. **Deck Data Loading** - Loading CardData from Resources
2. **Deck State Management** - Managing draw/discard piles
3. **Card Operations** - Drawing, discarding, shuffling
4. **UI Management** - Updating text components and panels
5. **Message Display** - Showing game messages
6. **Game Setup Logic** - Initial dealing and game state setup  
7. **Statistics/Debugging** - Providing deck stats

#### Substep 4.1: Create Specialized Managers
**Objective**: Split DeckManager responsibilities into focused components following Single Responsibility Principle

**1. Pure Deck Operations**:
```csharp
public class Deck : MonoBehaviour 
{
    [Header("Deck State")]
    public List<CardData> drawPile = new List<CardData>();
    public List<CardData> discardPile = new List<CardData>();
    
    [Header("Settings")]
    public int reshuffleThreshold = 5;
    
    // Events for other systems
    public System.Action<CardData> OnCardDrawn;
    public System.Action<CardData> OnCardDiscarded;
    public System.Action OnDeckShuffled;
    public System.Action OnDeckEmpty;
    
    public CardData DrawCard()
    public void DiscardCard(CardData card)
    public void Shuffle()
    public void ReshuffleDiscardIntoDraw()
    public CardData GetTopDiscardCard()
    
    // Properties
    public int DrawPileCount => drawPile.Count;
    public int DiscardPileCount => discardPile.Count;
    public bool HasCardsInDrawPile => drawPile.Count > 0;
    public bool HasCardsInDiscardPile => discardPile.Count > 0;
}
```

**2. Resource Management**:
```csharp
public class CardDataLoader : MonoBehaviour 
{
    [Header("Card Data")]
    public List<CardData> allCardData = new List<CardData>();
    
    public List<CardData> LoadAllCardData()
    public string GetDeckStats()
    public bool ValidateDeckComposition()
    
    // Properties
    public int TotalCardCount => allCardData.Count;
}
```

**3. UI Updates Only**:
```csharp
public class DeckUIManager : MonoBehaviour 
{
    [Header("UI References")]
    public TextMeshProUGUI drawPileCountText;
    public TextMeshProUGUI discardPileCountText;
    public TextMeshProUGUI gameMessageText;
    public Transform drawPilePanel;
    public Transform discardPilePanel;
    
    public void UpdateDeckUI(int drawCount, int discardCount)
    public void ShowMessage(string message)
    public void UpdateDiscardPileDisplay(CardData topCard)
}
```

**4. Game Setup Logic**:
```csharp
public class GameSetupManager : MonoBehaviour 
{
    [Header("Setup Settings")]
    public int initialHandSize = 8;
    
    [Header("Dependencies")]
    public CardDataLoader cardLoader;
    public Deck deck;
    
    public void InitializeNewGame()
    public (List<CardData> player1Hand, List<CardData> player2Hand, CardData startingCard) SetupInitialGame()
    public List<CardData> DrawInitialHand(int handSize)
    public CardData SelectStartingCard()
}
```

#### Substep 4.2: Refactor DeckManager (Coordinator Pattern)

**5. Simplified DeckManager (Coordinator)**:
```csharp
public class DeckManager : MonoBehaviour 
{
    [Header("Component References")]
    public Deck deck;
    public CardDataLoader cardLoader;
    public DeckUIManager deckUI;
    public GameSetupManager gameSetup;
    
    // Events for external systems
    public System.Action<CardData> OnCardDrawn;
    public System.Action<CardData> OnCardDiscarded;
    public System.Action OnDeckShuffled;
    public System.Action OnGameInitialized;
    
    void Start()
    void ConnectEvents()
    
    // Public API - delegates to appropriate managers
    public CardData DrawCard() => deck.DrawCard();
    public void DiscardCard(CardData card) => deck.DiscardCard(card);
    public List<CardData> DrawCards(int count) => gameSetup.DrawInitialHand(count);
    public CardData GetTopDiscardCard() => deck.GetTopDiscardCard();
    public void InitializeDeck() => gameSetup.InitializeNewGame();
    public (List<CardData>, List<CardData>, CardData) SetupInitialGame() => gameSetup.SetupInitialGame();
    
    // Properties - delegates to components
    public int DrawPileCount => deck.DrawPileCount;
    public int DiscardPileCount => deck.DiscardPileCount;
    public bool HasCardsInDrawPile => deck.HasCardsInDrawPile;
    public bool HasCardsInDiscardPile => deck.HasCardsInDiscardPile;
}
```

#### Substep 4.3: Integration & Testing
- Connect all components together with proper event system
- Verify all existing functionality still works
- Test that separation doesn't break anything
- Update any dependent scripts
- Ensure UI updates work properly between components

**Acceptance Criteria**:
‚úÖ All components properly separated with single responsibilities  
‚úÖ Event system working correctly between components  
‚úÖ Existing functionality preserved after refactoring  
‚úÖ No breaking changes to public API  
‚úÖ 110 cards load and distribute correctly  
‚úÖ UI updates reflect deck state accurately  
‚úÖ Improved code maintainability and testability  
‚úÖ Architecture prepared for future multiplayer features

**Benefits of This Refactoring**:
‚úÖ **Single Responsibility** - Each class has one clear job  
‚úÖ **Easier Testing** - Test deck operations separate from UI  
‚úÖ **Better Maintainability** - Changes to UI don't affect deck logic  
‚úÖ **Preparation for Multiplayer** - Deck logic separate from UI makes networking easier  
‚úÖ **Code Reusability** - Other systems can use Deck without UI dependencies

## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards
```csharp
// Namespace for all scripts
namespace TakiGame 
{
    // Clear, descriptive class names
    public class CardPlayValidator : MonoBehaviour
    {
        // Public fields with tooltips
        [Tooltip("Card to validate for play")]
        public CardData targetCard;
        
        // NO UNICODE in comments or strings
        // Use simple ASCII characters only
        
        /// <summary>
        /// Validates if card can be played according to TAKI rules
        /// </summary>
        public bool ValidateCardPlay()
        {
            // Implementation here
        }
    }
}
```

### File Organization Rules
- **Scripts**: Organized by responsibility (Managers/, Controllers/, UI/, Data/)
- **Assets**: Clear folder structure with no Unicode characters
- **Naming**: PascalCase for files, camelCase for variables
- **Comments**: English only, no special characters

### Refactored Architecture Benefits
**New Component Structure**:
```
DeckManager (Coordinator)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Deck (Pure card operations)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CardDataLoader (Resource management) 
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ DeckUIManager (UI updates only)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ GameSetupManager (Game initialization)
```

**Advantages**:
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a single, well-defined responsibility
- **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
- **Maintainability**: Changes to one aspect don't affect others
- **Reusability**: Components can be used by other systems
- **Multiplayer Ready**: Network synchronization easier with separated logic
- **Performance**: UI updates only when necessary

### Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Testing**: Each component tested independently
2. **Integration Testing**: Test component interactions  
3. **Gameplay Testing**: Verify rules work as expected
4. **Performance Testing**: Ensure smooth gameplay with full deck

### Error Handling
- Null reference checks for all card operations
- Graceful handling of empty piles
- User-friendly error messages
- Debug logging for development

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Challenges
1. **Component Communication**: Mitigated by clear event system and coordinator pattern
2. **Computer AI Difficulty**: Start simple, iterate based on gameplay
3. **Special Card Interactions**: Implement one at a time, test thoroughly
4. **UI Responsiveness**: Regular testing on target hardware

### Fallback Plans
- **Complex Cards**: If SuperTaki is too complex, implement basic TAKI first
- **AI Intelligence**: Random valid moves acceptable for first version  
- **Visual Polish**: Prioritize functionality over aesthetics
- **Audio**: Optional feature, can be added post-core completion

# My Notes:

- In `DeckManager.cs`:

    - What does `reshuffleThreshold` mean? I believe we should always reshuffle (meaning take all cards in discard pile minus the card that's at the top, shuffle them, and place in empty draw pile) the moment we see that: there are no cards in draw pile AND there is at least 2 cards in discard pile (if we only take 1 card to move over to draw pile, then no worries, the shuffle logic will simply not take place).
    So what we should do, is that EVERY TIME a (1) card is being drawn from the draw pile we check immidietly after: is the pile empty.
    So cards' logics have to be mindfull of this (the answer is making simple functions with uncomplicated responsebilities that can use other functions), for example, PlusTwo - you take 1 card, and then another, not a few at once.

    - `if (allCardData.Count == 110)` instead of `110` we should create a variable for expected initial card amount

    - In `DrawCard` we should reconsider it's implementation, since we might change/reconsider `reshuffleThreshold`

    - `DrawCards` looks well implemented and safe from what I can see since it calls `DrawCard` in a loop with checking. But I think we should add a logging message if the number of the count of requested cards hadn't been reached (due to no cards being available).

    - So, `DiscardCard` function is when a card from the draw pile is removed, and then add to the discard pile, But not when a card is being played by one of the players, right?

    - We have the following comment and function: 
        ```
        /// <summary>
		/// Set up initial game state (deal cards and place first discard)
		/// </summary>
		/// <returns>Lists of cards for each player and the starting discard card</returns>
		public (List<CardData> player1Hand, List<CardData> player2Hand, CardData startingCard) SetupInitialGame () {
        ```
    Tell me, what kind of function "title" is that? Does it have no name? How is it being called?

    - `UpdateUI` looks fine, but prompt me and I will tell you how I want to change the messages' text

    -
