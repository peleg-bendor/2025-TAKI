## Phase 7: Special Cards Implementation 🎯

## 🎯 **Current Focus: Basic Special Cards Implementation**

### **Primary Goal**: Implement real special card effects for PLUS, STOP, CHANGEDIRECTION, CHANGECOLOR
**Status**: 🎯 **IMMEDIATE FOCUS** - Ready for implementation

### **Current State**: All cards currently act as basic cards (end turn after playing)
**Target**: Make special cards have their unique effects

### **Implementation Priority Order**:

#### **1. Plus Card** 🔧
**Rule**: Player must take ONE additional action after playing Plus card
```csharp
// Implementation Logic:
- If PLUS played during normal gameplay (not TAKI sequence):
  - Player gets one additional action (PLAY or DRAW)
  - Cannot end turn until additional action taken
  - isActiveCard = true for PLUS cards
```

#### **2. Stop Card** 🛑
**Rule**: Skip opponent's next turn (player gets another full turn)
```csharp
// Implementation Logic:
- If STOP played during normal gameplay:
  - Opponent's turn is completely skipped
  - Player gets an entirely new turn
  - Use TurnManager.SkipTurn() functionality
```

#### **3. ChangeDirection Card** 🔄
**Rule**: Reverse turn direction (visual/message only for 2-player)
```csharp
// Implementation Logic:
- If CHANGEDIRECTION played during normal gameplay:
  - Update GameStateManager.turnDirection
  - Show appropriate UI message about direction change
  - No actual gameplay impact (2-player game)
```

#### **4. ChangeColor Card** 🎨
**Rule**: Player must choose new active color
```csharp
// Implementation Logic:
- If CHANGECOLOR played during normal gameplay:
  - Show ColorSelectionPanel
  - Disable PLAY/DRAW buttons until color selected
  - Set InteractionState.ColorSelection
  - Update activeColor when color chosen
```

### **Implementation Tasks**:

#### **A. Modify GameManager.HandleSpecialCardEffects()**:
```csharp
// Update existing method to implement real effects
// Currently only has placeholder logic
// Add proper special card handling for each type
```

#### **B. Add Special Card State Tracking**:
```csharp
// Add variables to track special card states:
- bool isWaitingForAdditionalAction = false; // For PLUS cards
```

#### **C. Update Turn Flow Logic**:
```csharp
// Modify strict turn flow to handle:
- Additional actions for PLUS cards
- Turn skipping for STOP cards  
- Color selection requirements for CHANGECOLOR cards
```

#### **D. Enhanced UI Integration**:
```csharp
// Update GameplayUIManager to show:
- Appropriate messages for each special card
- Color selection panel for CHANGECOLOR
- Additional action prompts for PLUS
```

### **Testing Strategy**:
- Test each special card type individually
- Verify turn flow remains strict and controlled
- Ensure AI can handle special cards appropriately
- Test special card combinations and edge cases

### **Cards NOT Modified in Phase 7**:
- **PLUSTWO**: Advanced chaining system (Phase 8)
- **TAKI**: Multi-card sequence system (Phase 8)  
- **SUPERTAKI**: Multi-card sequence system (Phase 8)

---

## Phase 8: Advanced Special Cards Implementation

### Future Milestone: Advanced Special Card Mechanics
**Objective**: Complex card interactions and chaining

#### **1. PlusTwo Card** 🎴
**Rule**: Chaining system - player can stack +2 cards or draw cards
```csharp
// Advanced Implementation:
- Track NumberOfChainedPlusTwos
- Allow stacking or force drawing
- AI strategy for PLUSTWO responses
```

#### **2. Taki Card** 🎯
**Rule**: Multi-card play sequence of same color
```csharp
// Advanced Implementation:
- TakiSequence interaction state
- Btn_Player1EndTakiSequence integration
- Multi-card validation system
```

#### **3. SuperTaki Card** 🌟
**Rule**: Multi-card play sequence of any color
```csharp
// Advanced Implementation:
- Same as TAKI essentially
- SuperTaki sequence management
```

**Tasks**:
- PlusTwo stacking system implementation
- Taki sequence validation and UI integration
- Special card combination rules
- Edge case handling for all special cards
- AI strategy enhancement for all special cards

## Current Architecture Highlights

### **Enhanced Manager Architecture**:
```csharp
// Complete game flow management
GameManager: Central coordinator with manager integration
PauseManager: Complete pause/resume with state preservation  
GameEndManager: Professional game end flow
ExitValidationManager: Safe exit with comprehensive cleanup
```

### **Strict Turn Flow System** (Enhanced):
```csharp

- Player takes ONE action (PLAY or DRAW)
- Action buttons immediately disabled on click
- END TURN button enabled only after action
- Clear feedback for all game states
- Ready for special card effect integration
- Enhanced button state tracking and validation
```

### **Multi-Enum State Management**:
```csharp
// Clean separation of state concerns with pause support
public enum TurnState { PlayerTurn, ComputerTurn, Neutral }
public enum InteractionState { Normal, ColorSelection, TakiSequence, PlusTwoChain }
public enum GameStatus { Active, Paused, GameOver }
```

### **Visual Card Architecture**:
```csharp
// Complete visual card system
CardController: Individual card behavior, image loading, selection
HandManager: Dynamic hand layout, card positioning, user interaction
PileManager: Draw/discard pile visual representation
```

### **Enhanced UI System**:
```csharp
// Complete UI management with pause/resume integration
GameplayUIManager: Enhanced with pause state handling
MenuNavigation: Complete pause/game end/exit integration
DeckUIManager: Clean separation of deck-only UI
```

---

## Development Guidelines

### Architecture Principles
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each component has single responsibility
- **Event-Driven Communication**: Components communicate via events
- **Coordinator Pattern**: Managers delegate to specialized components  
- **Multi-Enum State**: Separate enums for different state aspects
- **Visual-Data Separation**: CardData separate from visual representation
- **Strict Turn Flow**: One action per turn with enforced completion
- **Clean Logging**: Categorized, level-controlled debugging information
- **State Preservation**: Complete pause/resume capability
- **Safe Cleanup**: Comprehensive system cleanup for memory leak prevention

### Current Development Workflow
1. **Start with Special Cards**: Implement PLUS, STOP, CHANGEDIRECTION, CHANGECOLOR effects
2. **Test in Controlled Environment**: Use strict turn flow for safe testing
3. **Minimal Console Spam**: Use TakiLogger for organized debugging
4. **Preserve Architecture**: Maintain clean separation of concerns
5. **State-Aware Development**: Consider pause/resume in all new features
